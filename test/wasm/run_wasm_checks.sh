# This is the fast, deterministic gate for the LINKED_LIBS class of bug
# (see check_wasm_imports.mjs for the full explanation). It does NOT need a
# duckdb-wasm runtime or a matching duckdb version — it statically inspects
# the side module's imports. Run it after `make wasm_mvp` / `wasm_eh`.
#
# Usage: test/wasm/run_wasm_checks.sh [build-dir ...]
#   defaults to build/wasm_mvp build/wasm_eh build/wasm_threads if present.

# Purpose of this Document

This document is a historical summary of the first chat that initiated this project. It captures some of the preliminary concepts and ideas explored in a chat prior to creating the project. None of the information in here should be considered up-to-date but simply used for context or to illustrate the thought process throughout the project.

# History
I am trying to write an extension for DuckDB that is based off their built-in JSON extensions but replaces yyjson with yyyaml to allow for parsing of YAML files as well. This will need to be implemented in C++ following and should be almost identical to the JSON implementation in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/extension/json. It does not need to implement all YAML features and should serve primarily to read simple YAML documents into DuckDB.

You previously began creating this and the code is made available to you in the attached github repository.

# Implementation Summary

I've created a comprehensive implementation plan for a YAML extension for DuckDB, based on the existing JSON extension but replacing yyjson with yaml-cpp for YAML parsing. Here's a summary of what I've provided:

## Extension Setup: Instructions for setting up the extension from the DuckDB extension template.

## Core Implementation Files:

 * Main extension registration (yaml_extension.cpp)
 * YAML logical type implementation (yaml_types.hpp/cpp)
 * YAML functions registry (yaml_functions.hpp/cpp)
 * Reader implementation for YAML files (yaml_reader.hpp/cpp)

## YAML Functions:

* Extract functions to retrieve data from YAML documents
 * Structure functions to analyze YAML structure
 * Creation functions to generate YAML documents
 * Transform functions to convert YAML to DuckDB types

## Testing:

 * Sample YAML file for testing
 * SQL test script to verify functionality

## Documentation:

 * Comprehensive README with usage examples

## Key Design Aspects

* Substituting yyjson with yaml-cpp: The implementation leverages yaml-cpp as a replacement for yyjson. The main difference is in handling the parsing and serialization of YAML vs JSON, but the overall architecture follows the same pattern.
 * YAML Path Navigation: I've implemented a path-based navigation system similar to the JSON implementation, with support for dot notation and array indices.
 * YAML to DuckDB Type Conversion: The extension provides functions to convert YAML values to appropriate DuckDB types, with support for nested structures.
 * File Reading: The read_yaml function enables reading YAML files directly into DuckDB tables, similar to the read_json function.

## Next Steps

* Build and Test: This code should be built and tested in a DuckDB environment with the extension template.
 * Optimizations: Performance optimizations may be needed, especially for large YAML files.
 * Extended Features: Additional YAML-specific features like support for anchors and aliases could be added in future versions.
 * YAML Writer: Implement a YAML writer to export DuckDB tables as YAML files.
 * Distribution: Package the extension for distribution through DuckDB's extension system.

This implementation should provide a solid foundation for parsing and querying YAML files in DuckDB, similar to how the JSON extension works but tailored to YAML's syntax and features.

# Code Review Summary

You performed a comprehensive code review [which is omitted here but can be performed again if needed]. Below are some questions you asked and broad takeaways you provided. 

## Questions for Further Development
 * How critical is support for YAML-specific features like anchors and aliases in your use case? This would significantly increase implementation complexity.
 * Do you need to support multi-document YAML files? This would require changes to the reader implementation.
 * What's the expected size of the YAML files you'll be processing? This impacts how we handle memory allocation and buffering.
 * Do you need bidirectional conversion (DuckDB to YAML)? The current implementation focuses more on reading YAML into DuckDB.
 * Would you prefer null values or exceptions for conversion errors? Currently, the implementation mixes both approaches.
 * What compatibility level with the JSON extension is required? Should all JSON-equivalent functions work the same way?

## Recommended Improvements

* Complete Missing Implementations: Fill in the YAMLReadFunction and other incomplete code segments.
 * Add Context Parameters: Update function signatures to include ClientContext where appropriate.
 * Standardize Error Handling: Choose a consistent approach (NULL values or exceptions).
 * Add Support for YAML-Specific Features: If needed, implement support for anchors, aliases, and multi-document files.
 * Optimize Memory Usage: Consider streaming approaches for large files.
 * Add Documentation: Include YAML-specific behavior notes in the README.
 * Add Comprehensive Tests: Develop tests covering a wide range of YAML structures and edge cases.

This extension provides a solid foundation, but these improvements would significantly enhance its robustness and usability.

## Follow-up

I provided the following response to your code review comments:

> Please make the recommended improvements and update the code created above to address just the types and reader functionality as well as the tests for those features.
> Answers for the questions posed:
> 1. For now, we can ignore anchors and aliases or model them explicitly as new kinds of types.
> 2. We should support multi-document yaml files, treating them as if we had loaded multiple files.
> 3. Processing in memory is fine for now.
> 4. We should be able to export to YAML just as we can write to JSON.
> 5. For now, we should raise exceptions but consider offering parameters that can be used to tune error handling.
> 6. For now, let's focus on reading documents into standard DuckDB types or to JSON so that we can use those functions instead of re-implementing them. In-fact, parsing or casting into a JSON type is a reasonable approach.

# Next Steps

You provided updates to the code, which you summarized below.

## Summary of Improvements

### Type System Integration:

Created a more robust YAML type system with proper casting between YAML and JSON
Implemented comprehensive type detection for YAML nodes
Added support for converting various DuckDB types to YAML

### Multi-Document Support:

Added full support for YAML documents with multiple document sections
Implemented proper parsing and handling of multi-document YAML files
Provided options to control multi-document behavior

### Error Handling:

Standardized error handling with exceptions
Added ignore_errors option for flexible error recovery during parsing
Improved error reporting with descriptive messages

### JSON Integration:

Added seamless conversion between YAML and JSON formats
Enabled leveraging existing DuckDB JSON functions with YAML data
Provided a direct yaml_to_json table function for converting YAML files to JSON

### Reader Improvements:

Implemented proper ClientContext parameters in function signatures
Enhanced the DataChunk creation for YAML records
Added support for explicit column types and auto-detection

### Comprehensive Testing:

 * Created basic tests for core functionality
 * Added tests for advanced YAML structures
 * Added multi-document test cases with complex nesting

## Architectural Decisions

### Leveraging JSON Functionality:

 * Rather than reimplementing all JSON functions for YAML, we focused on providing solid YAML-to-JSON conversion
 * This approach allows users to utilize DuckDB's extensive JSON functions with YAML data

### Type Detection:

* Implemented intelligent type detection based on YAML content
* Added options to override auto-detection with explicit type specification

### Performance Considerations:

 * Focused on in-memory processing for initial implementation
 * Added safeguards like maximum object size limits

### Extensibility:

 * Designed the extension to be easily extended with additional YAML-specific features
 * Kept the code modular for future improvements

This implementation provides a solid foundation for working with YAML files in DuckDB while leveraging the existing JSON capabilities. It handles both simple YAML files and complex multi-document structures while providing good error handling and conversion options.
